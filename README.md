# GraphPartitionAlgorithm
Branch and Bound algorithm for the graph partition problem.

Graph Partiton Problem -- Given a weighted, undirected graph G=(V,E). The problem is to partition V into two disjoint subsets V1 and V2 of equal size such that the sum of weights of edges connecting vertices belonging to different subsets is as small as possible.
